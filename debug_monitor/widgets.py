"""
Eventual home of the custom widgets we're going to need for our application.

It should have at least the following:

* A selectable, dynamically updating list that will hold requests and reponses.
* A dynamically changing list of buttons (or something like it) that will be
updated with the data we receive for any given request.
* Some kind of filtering support.
